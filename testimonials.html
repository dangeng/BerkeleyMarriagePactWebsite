  <p>Hi YC!</p>

<p>Here are some (cherry picked) Berkeley Marriage Pact testimonials that we thought were truly amazing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What I thought was hilarious was that my match was my boyfriend and both of us were absolutely dying when we got each other. I wanna know how we were matches together.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Honestly it’s going really well and everyone in our lives is shocked LOL. Congrats to y’all and your algorithm :)”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You guys honestly nailed it. The algorithm you put together is great, so happy with my match. We have already gone out twice, with plans to go out again next week and things are looking good. I really appreciate this survey because I never had the confidence to ask someone out, and got my first date (and hopefully first girlfriend) out of this :)”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) I enjoyed the data set and trends breakdown – I don’t know if you posted it on social media but if I didn’t take the survey I would’ve loved to see it anyways (so maybe post it if you haven’t?). 
2) I heard from a close friend that she and her boyfriend took the test and somehow got matched together (so wow good job I’m impressed – but also sorry for maybe fucking up your matches but my boyfriend and I took it as well and didn’t get matched so…………. hopefully that doesn’t say anything about our relationship). 
3) Kudos to whoever organized this and especially to the writers, 10/10 humour would read again. (High-key just choosing to stay in contact in hopes of some witty response.)”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from the Berkeley confession’s Facebook page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I went on my Berkeley Marriage Pact date and had a lot of fun. But I feel that both of us were pretty much under the impression that this would be a joke-date. But in the end I actually liked them and I would be so down for another date but how can I go on another date if the first one wasn’t an actual date like what. I don’t know if it’s weird to ask to go on another date. Because yeah we may be “compatible” according to the algorithm but I don’t know if they’re into me appearance wise yk. They agreed to go on the date because we thought it’d be a funny experience and not necessarily because they were attracted to me. Like Ik that’s shallow but if they don’t know much about me they’re gonna rely a bit on my appearance when it comes to deciding if they actually wanna go out right ?”</p>
